<h2>History</h2>
<p>It is told in the bible that the temple of solomon was built using gold form the land of ophir.over the centuries 
historians have speculated on what present day ophir is.</p> 
<h2>Was Rhodesia Ophir?<h2/>
<p class="noteBox">There is a border around this text>The vexed question as to whether the land of Monomotapa (Rhodesia) was the land of Ophir can best be stated by considering the Himyaritic occupation, for we find from sacred and secular writings that it was the merchants of Sheba who, in addition to being the gold merchants of the whole world, also exported to the Phoenician centres of Tyre and Sidon practically all the enormous quantity of gold those wealthy cities required, and which history avers they possessed — "Tyre heaped up…fine gold as the mire of the streets" (Zech.). It is admitted that the gold mines of the Ural Mountains could not have contributed more than a fraction of the quantity of gold possessed by the Phoenician Canaanites. Old Roman and Grecian historians are unanimous in stating that the Himyarites were the gold merchants of the world and that they purveyed it to all the then known countries, but none suggest that the gold came from Yemen, while all assert that it was brought by the Himyarites.</p>
<p>Having ruled on or around 970BCE, the legendary King Solomon is arguably one of the most recognizable characters within the pages of the Old Testament. The third King of Israel, Solomon was a renowned ruler that oversaw a growth from a single state into a venerable superpower of the Middle East in biblical times. During his near four decade regency, the King had a reputation not too dissimilar to that of a certain James Bond. King Solomon had another aspect to his legend. That was his immense wealth from gold that historians say came from the lost mine of Ophir somewhere in the Middle East.</p>

<h2>Africa</h2>

<p>Tomé Lopes is best known today for being the scrivener to famed Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama. Lopes proposed that Ophir was an original, certainly ancient, name for Great Zimbabwe. During the Renaissance period, this was the central hub of all trade in African gold. Archaeologists have dated the ruins in this region to the medieval era, and they cannot possibly derive from Solomon at all.</p>
